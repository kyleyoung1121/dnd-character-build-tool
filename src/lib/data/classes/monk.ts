		Starting at 2nd level, your training allows you to harness the mystic energy of ki. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of ki points. Your monk level determines the number of ki points you have. You can spend these points to fuel various ki features like Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind. When you spend a ki point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended ki points back into yourself. You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your ki points. Some of your ki features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows: Ki save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier.
