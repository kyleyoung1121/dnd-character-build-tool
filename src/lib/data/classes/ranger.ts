						You gain a beast companion that accompanies you on your adventures and is trained to fight alongside you. Choose a beast that is no larger than Medium and that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower. <br><br>
						• Add your proficiency bonus to the beast's AC, attack rolls, and damage rolls, as well as to any saving throws and skills it is proficient in <br>
						• Its hit point maximum equals the hit point number in its stat block or four times your ranger level, whichever is higher <br>
						• The beast obeys your commands as best as it can and takes its turn on your initiative <br>
						• On your turn, you can verbally command the beast where to move (no action required by you) <br>
						• You can use your action to verbally command it to take the Attack, Dash, Disengage, or Help action <br>
						• If you don't issue a command, the beast takes the Dodge action <br><br>
						While traveling through your favored terrain with only the beast, you can move stealthily at a normal pace. <br><br>
						If the beast dies, you can obtain a new companion by spending 8 hours magically bonding with a beast that isn't hostile to you and that meets the requirements.
